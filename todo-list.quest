0. ✅ Add status tracking for each committer.
1. ✅ Add quest publishing logic: only approved providers can publish.
2. ✅ Add quest commiting logic: everyone can commit but one committer can only commit once to the same quest.
3. ✅ Add quest submitting logic: the committer who committed to the quest can submit to the quest only once.
4. ✅ Add quest grading logic: only the quest publisher can grade the quest. Gradings for each committer cannot be changed once published.
5. ✅ Add quest modification logic: only the quest publisher can modify the quest.
9. Break the quest architecture down to a main-logic-storage design.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. implement check skill nft.
2. implement consume skill nft.
3. implement dedicated logic for dedicated quests.
5. implement the skill token issuance function in grade after the reputation contract is ready.
6. too many repetitive codes currently in the contract, trim it before implementing the modification function.
7. what part of quest is modifiable needs to be carefully designed.
8. the modification for different types of quests should be different.
9. need to delete the extention field, since modification is itself a method of extension.
10. implement automatic closing after the quest is broken down into a main-logic-storage design.
